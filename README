Paper Manager
=============

This program provides a viewer for image files such as pdf, jpeg and
its own variant of PaperPort's .max file format.


Features
--------

- simple GUI based around stacks and pages
- view previews and browse through pages
- move pages in and out of stacks
- navigate through directories
- move stacks between directories
- double click to view full size page image (also on right pane)
- print stacks and pages, including page annotations
- full undo/redo


new in 0.4:
- basic scanning
- partial creation of .max files (but monochrome images are uncompressed)
       (also it doesn't create greyscale/colour previews)


new in 0.5:
- better scanning, should now work properly with SANE and most scanners
- stacking/unstacking, moving files between directories, etc.
- colour previews are created (greyscale still not sorry)
- PDF, JPEG and TIFF conversion supported. Results may vary
- View quality menu to trade speed for quality


new in 0.7:
- better multithreaded scanning
- undo/redo
- better PDF support
- preview panes
- OCR engine
- zooming in and out in preview windows (hold down control and use
     mouse wheel)
- rewritten for QT4
- many many other changes and improvements


new in 0.7.1:
- a few bug fixes


new in 0.8
- first github release
- new icon
- cleaned up README


new in 1.0
- fully ported to QT4
- should build on very modern distributions that don't have QT3


Future Features
---------------

Here's what I'd like it to support:

- more operations on images
- support for more image types (at the moment only JPEG is supported)

If you have other ideas then feel free to let me know on the mailing list.
